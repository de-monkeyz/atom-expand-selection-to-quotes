The original package seems to have disappeared and has deprecations, so I am reposting it with fixes.\n\nThis project is based on the awesome work of kek in [sublime-expand-selection-to-quotes](https://github.com/kek/sublime-expand-selection-to-quotes).\n\n## Known Issues\n* Currently only supports one cursor.\n* It assumes that the type of quote to the left of the cursor is the one we want, which is stupid and not always true.\n",
